Mobility, an open-source library for mobility modelisation
==========================================================
Mobility is an open-source solution to compute the carbon emissions due to the mobility of a local population.

It is developed mainly by `AREP <https://arep.fr>`_ and `Elioth <https://elioth.com>`_ with `ADEME <https://wiki.resilience-territoire.ademe.fr/wiki/Mobility>`_ support, but anyone can join us!
For now, it is mainly focused on French territories.
