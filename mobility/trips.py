        Samples long distance trips and short distance trips from survey data (prepared with prepare_survey_data),
        for a specific person's profile (CSP, urban unit category, number of persons and cars of the household).

        Determines the number of cars using the repartition for this urban unit category, CSP and number of persons.
        If data is not sufficient for that triplet, only uses urban unit category and CSP.

        Computes the number of travels (n_travels) during the n_years thanks to the travels_db.
        n_travels are sampled.
        The long_trips associated to these travels are added to the data.

        Thanks to these travels, the number of professional and personal days of travel may be known.
        Local trips made at the travel destination are not included in the source data, so they are estimated:
        for each day at destination, local trips are produced (weekdays for professional travel, week-end days for personal).
        The urban unit category of the destination is used, but the same number or cars is kept.

        The number of days without travels is then deduced (using a 364 days year):
            Week days without travel : 52*5 - number of days of professional travels
            Week-end days without travel : 52*2 - number of days of personal travels
            Doing that, we assume that all professonal trips are made during weekdays and all personal trips during week-ends.
        This assumption is obviously incorrect, and can lead to negative values. This is a point to fix.

        The number of days of immobility is computed using the number without travels and the probability of immobility.
        For the days with mobility, short trips are sampled (separately for week and week-end days).
